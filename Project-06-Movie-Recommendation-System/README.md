# 🎬 Day 06 - Movie Recommendation System

Part of my **100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge**

**Project Number:** 06/100
**Category:** Recommendation Systems / NLP

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Flask.

The system recommends movies similar to a selected movie by analyzing:

* Genres
* Keywords
* Cast
* Crew
* Movie Overview

using NLP techniques and Cosine Similarity.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Content-Based Recommendation Engine

✅ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

✅ Text Vectorization using CountVectorizer

✅ Cosine Similarity-Based Recommendations

✅ Top 5 Similar Movie Suggestions

✅ Interactive Flask Web Application

✅ Modern Responsive User Interface

✅ Searchable Movie Selection

✅ Recommendation Cards with Ranking

Dataset Used:

**TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**

Files:

* tmdb_5000_movies.csv
* tmdb_5000_credits.csv

Total Movies:

* 4800+ Movies

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

Merged:

* Movies Dataset
* Credits Dataset

### 2. Feature Selection

Selected Features:

* genres
* keywords
* overview
* cast
* crew

### 3. Feature Engineering

Created a new feature called **tags** by combining:

* Overview
* Genres
* Keywords

* Crew

### 4. NLP Preprocessing

Performed:

* Tokenization
* Lowercasing
* Stemming using Porter Stemmer

### 5. Vectorization

Used:

* CountVectorizer

Parameters:

* max_features = 5000
* stop_words = "english"

### 6. Similarity Calculation

Used:

* Cosine Similarity

### 7. Recommendation Generation

The system finds the five most similar movies based on content similarity.
